# Traffic Safety Prediction
Application of ML algorithms in the context of traffic safety analysis
## Overview
Three algorithms are tested for crash severity and frequency analysis, including decision tree (CART), random forest, and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB). Model development, optimization, and evaluation are jointly compared with statistical approaches in the study field (i.e., logistic regression and negative binomial regression models).
